# Expense Tracker (CLI - Go)

A **Command-Line Expense Tracker** written in **Go**, designed to help you quickly log and analyze expenses from your terminal. Expenses are stored in a **CSV** file, making it lightweight, portable, and easy to back up.

## Installation

### Clone and Build

```bash
git clone https://github.com/idukrystal/Expense-Tracker.git
cd Expense-Tracker/expense-tracker
go build -o expense

Make the CLI Globally Accessible

To make the expense command available globally, move the compiled binary to a directory that is included in your system's PATH.

Option 1: Move to /usr/local/bin/ (system-wide, requires sudo)

sudo mv expense /usr/local/bin/

Option 2: Move to ~/bin/ (user-specific, no sudo needed)

1. Create the ~/bin/ directory if it doesn't exist:

mkdir -p ~/bin


2. Move the binary to ~/bin/:

mv expense ~/bin/


3. Add ~/bin to your PATH if it's not already there:

Open your shell configuration file (~/.bashrc, ~/.zshrc, or ~/.bash_profile) and add the following line:

export PATH="$HOME/bin:$PATH"


4. Reload the shell configuration:

source ~/.bashrc
# or
source ~/.zshrc



Verify the Global Availability

Once the binary is placed in a directory within your PATH, you can run the expense command from any directory in the terminal:

expense --help

This should show you the help message, confirming that the app is available globally.
